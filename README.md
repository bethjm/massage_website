## Technical Aspects

- **React.js:** The website is built using the React.js framework, allowing for a modular and component-based approach to development. This facilitates code reusability and maintainability, making it easier to update and enhance different sections of the website.

- **React Router:** The application utilizes React Router for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different pages and ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Reusable Components:** Emphasizing the use of reusable components enhances code modularity and scalability. By breaking down the website's UI into reusable building blocks, it becomes easier to manage and update different sections of the site.

- **Custom APIs:** Two custom APIs were developed to integrate dynamic content into the website. These APIs provide the necessary data for displaying massage services and frequently asked questions, enabling data-driven functionality.
